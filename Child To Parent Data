add a props in parent with function running on it.

use that props in child 
add data as  a parameter in that props ().
you can add that in a function, which can run on click etc

come to parent component and run another function on that props.

add a parameter in that function

and now the data is passed in that parameter
you can use that parameter now in parent div where ever you want
